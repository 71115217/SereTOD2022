# SereTod Motivation 
Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are designed to assist users to accomplish their goals, and have gained more and more attention recently in both academia and
industry with the current advances in neural approaches. A TOD system typically consists of several modules, which track user goals to update dialog states, query a
task-related knowledge base (KB) using the dialog states, decide actions and generate responses. Unfortunately, building TOD systems remains a label-intensive, timeconsuming task for two main reasons. First, training neural TOD systems requires manually labeled dialog states and system acts (if used), in both traditional modular approach and recent end-to-end trainable approach. Second, it is often assumed that a task-related knowledge base is available. But for system development from scratch in many real-world tasks, expert labors are needed to construct the KB from annotating unstructured data. Thus, the labeled-data scarcity challenge hinders efficient development of TOD systems at scale.   
Therefore，we introduce a new shared task "Towards Semi-Supervised and Reinforced Task-Oriented Dialog Systems (SereTOD)", aiming to benchmark semi-supervised task-oriented dialog systems, built for automated customer-service for mobile operators. The task consists of two tracks: information extraction from dialog transcripts (Track 1) and semi-supervised taskoriented dialog systems (Track 2).
