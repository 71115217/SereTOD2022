# SereTOD Track1: Information Extraction from dialog transcripts
This repository contains the task, evaluation, data and baseline codes for SereTOD Track1. 
# Task    
In a task-oriented dialog system, after dialog state tracking, the system needs to query a task-related knowledge base. Given a mix of labeled and unlabeled dialog transcripts, Track 1 examines the task of training information extraction models to construct the “local” knowledge base for each dialog, which will be needed in training TOD systems in Track 2. The knowledge base is local in the sense that the mentioned entities with their mentioned attributes are extracted across all turns in a dialog, but there is no information fusion between dialogs2. With such knowledge base, we will be able to drive the training of the TOD system. Therefore, we define two sub-tasks.  
1) Entity extraction. This sub-task is to extract entities with their corresponding concepts, which are mentioned in a dialog session. In real-life dialogs, an entity
may be mentioned in different surface forms, which need to be extracted. For example, “50元流量包” (50 Yuan data package plan) may have a number of different mentions in a multi-turn dialog: “50元那个业务” (50 Chinese Yuan plan), “那个流量包” (that package plan), “刚才那个业务” (that plan). Thus, entity extraction for the MCSD dataset is more challenging than classic named entity recognition tasks (e.g., extracting person names), due to the informal, verbalized and loose form of the customer-service dialogs.  
2) Slot filling. This sub-task is to extract slot values for entity slots (i.e., attributes). It is formulated as a sequence labeling task for the pre-defined slots in
the schema. For example, in sentence “10GB套餐业务每月的费用是50块钱。” (The price for 10GB data package plan is 50 Chinese Yuan per month), “每月的费用是50块钱” (50 Chinese Yuan per month) will be labeled as plan price slot. An entity may have several mentions in a dialog, and the slots and values for an entity may scatter in multi-turn dialogs. Thus, the task requires entity resolution and assigning slot-value pairs to the corresponding entity. After entity extraction and slot filling, a local knowledge base will be constructed with all extracted entities with their attributes for each dialog.  
# Evaluation  
Given a dialog in testing, the trained information extraction model is used to extract entities together with slot values. We will evaluate and rank the submitted models by the extraction performance on test set. The evaluation metrics are Precision, Recall and F1.  
1) As for entity extraction, the metrics are at entity level: an entity is extracted correctly if and only if the mention span of the entity is labeled as the corresponding entity type (i.e., concept).  
2) As for slot filling, the metrics are at triple level: an entity-slot-value triple is extracted correctly if and only if 1) the mention span of the slot value is labeled as the corresponding slot type. 2) the slot-value pair is correctly assigned to the corresponding entity.
